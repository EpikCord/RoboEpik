Blood Brothers is a book by Willy Russell in 1983. The book is about a woman, Mrs Johnstone, who gave away one of her 2 twins as she was unable to manage the plethora of children she had already produced with her ex-husband, who she had married as she realised she "was 6 weeks overdue", who also left her once she aged and looked "nothing like Marilyn Monroe". She gives away one of her twins to a woman named Mrs Lyons who is unable to produce children. Mrs Lyons is also a rather wealthy woman, considering her husband, Mr Lyons, is a workaholic as he is seen leaving home for work at various times.

# Blood Brothers - Book Review

## What is it?
Blood brothers is a book written by Willy Russell in 1983. The book is about twins, in juxtaposition to each other's wealth. The twins have been named: Mickie Johnstone, the unfortunate twin, and Edward Lyons, the rather wealthy, fortunate and successful twin (which is shown later within the book).

## Why do they have different surnames?
The two twins have different surnames, as Mrs Johnstone, the biological mother of the twins, ***gave one away*** to Mrs Lyons, a wealthy woman who also happened to be Mrs Johnstone's boss. Mrs Johnstone worked (*foreshadowing*) for Mrs Lyons as a cleaner.

## Well how did that happen?
One day, the conversation of Mrs Johnstone being pregnant arose. As all this was happening, Mrs Lyons put "new shoes on the table!"This scene shows that Mrs Johnstone is superstitious, despite her defiance. At the time, it was believed that she was expecting **one** child, but later, she was told that she was expecting **twins**. After this great shock, Mrs Johnstone informed Mrs Lyons of the *twins*. Simultaneously, Mrs Lyons had revealed that she was unable to produce children<!-- or somethin like that idk I never paid attention in class. If you're reading this Miss Gurcali hi. This formatting is nice and cool and deserves something like a point, can't remember the exact name of, something like Pray Point? You'll figure this out. And no, you shouldn't be able to read this and no I don't have Github Copilot to make this up for me.-->. Mrs Johnstone is rather unwealthy and unable to maintain and manage another 2 children alongside her already large plethora of children, so she decides to give one to Mrs Lyons. This was easy to accomplish as **Mr** Lyons was away from home on a business trip and has recently tried to produce a child, although Mrs Lyons went to the doctors to check if she is pregnant and was proven False, she made the plan of lying to her husband and saying the doctors were wrong. It had only been 4 months of pregnancy and only now was Mrs Johnstone's baby bump starting to show, so Mrs Lyons easily could reflect these changes within herself to fool everyone. Coincidentally, Mr Lyons would be returning within 5 months, making the 9 months for giving birth, making it much easier to fool people. With the knowledge of Mrs Johnstone being superstitious, Mrs Lyons decided to make Mrs Johnstone swear on the Bible (which was a rather big deal) that she would tell no one of the exchange. Mrs Johnstone reluctantly agrees.

## Well what now?
Fast forward 5 months, to the delivery of the twins, as Mrs Lyons approaches Mrs Johnstone to take one of the 2, Mrs Johnstone tries to extend the "deal", asking to "keep them for a few more days" but Mrs Lyons refuses.
Mr Lyons is due back tomorrow, so this wouldn't work out for Mrs Lyons. With all this agony, Mrs Johnstone lets her "just take him" and not tell "which one" she is taking.
